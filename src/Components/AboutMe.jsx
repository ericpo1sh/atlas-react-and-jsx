      <p>Hi, My name is Eric Dzyk. I am currently in T5 of the fullstack web spec at atlas school! My favorite languages or technologies would definetly be react and js, I really love how well they work together! After school graduation, I hope to find a good job at a big marketingcompany that makes different websites for people in react! Some of my hobbies include, buying, fixing, selling auction cars and restoring their life once again!</p>
